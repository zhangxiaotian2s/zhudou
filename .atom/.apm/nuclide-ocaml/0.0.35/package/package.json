Merlin can be installed from source or by installing the `merlin` OPAM package.\n\nIt requires that `ocamlmerlin` be installed on your system and properly configured for your project. `ocamlmerlin` should be on your `PATH`. If it is not, you may specify the path to `ocamlmerlin` in the settings for this package.\n\n## Features\n\n* Autocomplete: You should see autocomplete results with types appear as you type.\n* Jump to definition: If you install the [`hyperclick`](https://atom.io/packages/hyperclick) package, you will be able to `cmd` or `alt` click on a symbol to jump to the location where it is defined.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/facebooknuclideapm/nuclide-ocaml/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/facebooknuclideapm/nuclide-ocaml#readme","_id":"nuclide-ocaml@0.0.35","_shasum":"bd6f04ae9fa6c544f93d0897307198539b1f5f97","_resolved":"file:../d-1151116-10804-12fhyes/package.tgz","_from":"../d-1151116-10804-12fhyes/package.tgz"}
