Test runner calls `onDidStart`\n3. Test runner calls any or none of its output methods:\n  * `onDidRunSummary` (max: 1 time) prior to running tests with an overview of the test classes it\n    will run\n  * `onDidRunTest` (max: none) after a test is run with an object describing the test\n  * `onStdoutData` (max: none) with unstructured stdout data that does not fit in `onDidRunTest`\n  * `onStderrData` (max: none) with unstructured stderr data\n  * `onError` (max: 1 time) when an unrecoverable error occurs; further output is ignored\n4. Test runner calls `onDidEnd`\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/facebooknuclideapm/nuclide-test-runner/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/facebooknuclideapm/nuclide-test-runner#readme","_id":"nuclide-test-runner@0.0.35","_shasum":"fefc3453d58c9095f71e2ca4aca642a0186f7f0c","_resolved":"file:../d-1151116-11205-1t8vi30/package.tgz","_from":"../d-1151116-11205-1t8vi30/package.tgz"}
