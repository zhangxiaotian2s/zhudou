For example, if you wanted the shortcut to require the `shift` key when\npressing the arrow to distinguish it from the default shortcut, add the following to your\n`~/.atom/keymap.cson`:\n\n```coffee\n'.platform-darwin atom-workspace':\n  'cmd-k shift-up': 'nuclide-move-pane:move-tab-to-new-pane-up'\n  'cmd-k shift-down': 'nuclide-move-pane:move-tab-to-new-pane-down'\n  'cmd-k shift-left': 'nuclide-move-pane:move-tab-to-new-pane-left'\n  'cmd-k shift-right': 'nuclide-move-pane:move-tab-to-new-pane-right'\n\n'.platform-win32 atom-workspace, .platform-linux atom-workspace':\n  'ctrl-k shift-up': 'nuclide-move-pane:move-tab-to-new-pane-up'\n  'ctrl-k shift-down': 'nuclide-move-pane:move-tab-to-new-pane-down'\n  'ctrl-k shift-left': 'nuclide-move-pane:move-tab-to-new-pane-left'\n  'ctrl-k shift-right': 'nuclide-move-pane:move-tab-to-new-pane-right'\n```\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/facebooknuclideapm/nuclide-move-pane/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/facebooknuclideapm/nuclide-move-pane#readme","_id":"nuclide-move-pane@0.0.35","_shasum":"b6ffa4dbe66cdabca014b289ef2bd7125354b192","_resolved":"file:../d-1151116-10786-na93nt/package.tgz","_from":"../d-1151116-10786-na93nt/package.tgz"}
