Fixing the AST is the job of another tool.\n\n### We do:\n\n* Add trailing commas\n* Add parens around the single argument in an arrow function\n\n### We don't:\n\n* Separate long string literals with `+` so the line can break\n  * May be worth doing this since it almost has to be done within a formatter,\n  it doesn't make much sense for this to be done as a transform with no context\n  of how the code will be printed.\n* Switch the type of quotes around string literals\n  * This can change how things must be escaped\n  * Could potentially fix this by not considering `literal.raw` part of the AST,\n  but `literal.raw` is required in order to print integral number literals that\n  exceed `MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`\n* Simplify unnecessary parenthesis around series of expressions\n\n## Code Patterns and Terminology\n\n### Simple\n\nSimple means that no context is needed in order to produce the output. Nodes\nbelow the tree rooted at the current node are not considered additional context.\n\n### Complex\n\nComplex means that context is required to produce the output. This means nodes\nabove, or siblings of the current node are required.\n\n### Printer\n\nA printer takes in a node and any context in order to produce an array of lines.\n\n### Wrapper\n\nA wrapper is similar to a printer except that it also takes in some already\nprinted lines.\n\n### Resolver\n\nA resolver works on lines and options (not the full context) in order to remove\nmarkers.\n\n### Marker\n\nA marker is a special string that conveys some information to a resolver. It may\ntell the resolver to add a space, or that it's okay to break at the current\nlocation.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"fb","email":"opensource+npm@fb.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-11-25T18:48:45.321Z","created":"2015-10-28T02:27:45.664Z","0.0.0":"2015-10-28T02:27:45.664Z","0.0.34":"2015-11-12T01:23:04.300Z","0.0.35":"2015-11-25T18:48:45.321Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/facebook/nuclide#readme","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/facebook/nuclide.git"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","license":"SEE LICENSE IN LICENSE","_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"A5W5YTUF7I9SH67V4MFE7YEDJ\""}
